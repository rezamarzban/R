Refrigerator gases technical properties and cycles 

**Comprehensive Explanation of a Car’s Air Conditioning System**  
A car’s air conditioning system operates through a closed-loop thermodynamic cycle, leveraging phase changes of refrigerant and key components to transfer heat from the cabin to the outside environment. Here’s a detailed breakdown:  

---

### **1. Key Components & Processes**  
#### **Compressor (Adiabatic Compression)**  
- **Function**: The compressor pressurizes the refrigerant gas, initiating the cooling cycle.  
- **Adiabatic Process**:  
  - Compression occurs without heat exchange with the surroundings (adiabatic).  
  - Mechanical work from the engine compresses the gas, increasing its pressure, temperature, and internal energy.  
  - This high-pressure, high-temperature gas is sent to the condenser.  

#### **Condenser**  
- **Function**: Dissipates heat from the refrigerant to the outside air.  
- **Phase Change**:  
  - The hot gas cools to below its dew point at the given pressure, condensing into a high-pressure liquid.  
  - Subcooling (cooling below condensation temperature) may occur if the condenser is efficient.  

#### **Expansion Valve (Adiabatic Expansion)**  
- **Function**: Regulates refrigerant flow and causes a pressure drop.  
- **Adiabatic Process**:  
  - The high-pressure liquid undergoes a sudden pressure reduction (throttling), triggering partial evaporation.  
  - This phase change absorbs energy from the refrigerant itself, drastically lowering its temperature (e.g., from ~50°C to near 0°C).  
  - The refrigerant exits as a cold liquid-vapor mixture, ready to absorb heat in the evaporator.  

#### **Evaporator**  
- **Function**: Absorbs heat from the cabin air.  
- **Phase Change**:  
  - The cold refrigerant absorbs heat from the air blown over the evaporator coils, causing it to fully vaporize into a low-pressure gas.  
  - This cooled air is circulated back into the cabin.

### **2. System Preconditions for Optimal Operation**  
- **Adequate Refrigerant**: Ensures efficient heat transfer and prevents compressor damage.  
- **Safe Pressure Levels**: Avoids over-pressurization, allowing the expansion valve to function correctly.  
- **Condenser Temperature Below Dew Point**: Guarantees full condensation of refrigerant into a liquid (or subcooled state) before expansion,

### Notes on the Data

- **Boiling Point**: 
  - Values are at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm) unless otherwise noted.
  - For **CO₂ (R-744)**, the listed value (-78.5°C) is the *sublimation point* at 1 atm, as CO₂ sublimes rather than boils under standard conditions.

- **Latent Heat**:
  - Represents the latent heat of evaporation at the boiling point, sourced from **Engineering ToolBox**.
  - For **R-134a**, the value of 215 kJ/kg is an approximation at the boiling point (-26.3°C), as **Engineering ToolBox** provides 217 kJ/kg at 25°C; this slight adjustment ensures consistency.
  - For **CO₂ (R-744)**, the value (571 kJ/kg) is the *latent heat of sublimation* at -78.5°C, reflecting its phase change behavior.

- **Self-Ignition Temperature**:
  - **R-134a**, **R-22**, and **CO₂** are classified as non-flammable by **NIST**, so no self-ignition temperature is applicable (marked as "N/A (non-flammable)").
  - Values for **Ammonia**, **Propane**, and **Butane** are sourced from **Engineering ToolBox**.

- **Critical Temperature and Pressure**:
  - Sourced from **Engineering ToolBox** and cross-verified with **NIST** where available, ensuring precision.

# Safe Refrigerants 

### Key Points
- Research suggests boiling points, critical temperatures, and pressures for refrigerants are well-documented in standard engineering sources.
- Latent heat of evaporation and self-ignition temperatures vary, with many refrigerants being non-flammable, so self-ignition data may not always be available.
- The evidence leans toward using NIST and ASHRAE data for accuracy, though some values, especially for blends, are estimated.

### Boiling Points, Critical Temperatures, and Pressures
These properties are essential for understanding refrigerant behavior in systems. For example, R134a has a boiling point of -26.1°C, a critical temperature of 101.1°C, and a critical pressure of 4.06 MPa, based on NIST data.

### Latent Heat of Evaporation
This measures the heat absorbed during phase change, crucial for system efficiency. For R134a, it's around 216.0 kJ/kg, sourced from ASHRAE, with some blend values estimated due to limited direct data.

### Self-Ignition Temperature
Many refrigerants, like R134a, are non-flammable (classified as A1 by ASHRAE), so self-ignition temperature is not applicable. For slightly flammable ones (A2L, like R417A), specific data is often not found in standard tables.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Refrigerant Properties

This note provides a comprehensive analysis of refrigerant properties, including boiling points, critical temperatures, critical pressures, latent heat of evaporation, and self-ignition temperatures, for the requested refrigerants: R11, R12, R13, R113, R114, R500, R502, R503, R22, R23, R123, R124, R134a, R401A, R401B, R402A, R403B, R408A, R409A, R414B, R416A, R404A, R407C, R410A, R417A, R422A, R422B, R422D, R507, and R508. The data is sourced from reliable engineering references, primarily the NIST CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics and the ASHRAE Handbook, accessed through online searches and verified for accuracy as of April 11, 2025.

#### Background and Methodology
Refrigerants are critical for cooling systems, and their thermophysical properties are essential for design and operation. The task involved compiling a table with specific properties, ensuring data from authoritative sources like NIST and ASHRAE. The process included searching for and accessing online databases and handbooks, focusing on NIST's Chemistry WebBook, REFPROP, and ASHRAE standards. For self-ignition temperatures, safety classifications from ASHRAE Standard 34-2022 were used to determine applicability, given many refrigerants are non-flammable.

#### Data Compilation
The initial step was to identify sources. A search for "NIST refrigerant properties database" led to the NIST REFPROP database, described in a 2003 publication by McLinden et al. ([The Refprop Database for the Thermophysical Properties of Refrigerants | NIST](https://www.nist.gov/publications/refprop-database-thermophysical-properties-refrigerants)). Further, a table from the NIST CRC Handbook (accessed via [Properties of Refrigerants | NIST](https://www.nist.gov/publications/properties-refrigerants)) provided boiling points, critical temperatures, and pressures. For latent heat, the ASHRAE Handbook's Chapter 20, accessed via a 2005 NIST publication ([Chapter 20, Thermophysical Properties of Refrigerants, ASHRAE Handbook--Fundamentals (2005 revision) | NIST](https://www.nist.gov/publications/chapter-20-thermophysical-properties-refrigerants-ashrae-handbook-fundamentals-2005)), was used, with values converted from kJ/kg·mol to kJ/kg using molecular weights.

Self-ignition temperatures were challenging, as many refrigerants are non-flammable (A1 classification). Searches for "self-ignition temperature of refrigerants table" led to a University of Washington page ([Fuels > Autoignition Temperatures Detailed Results](https://depts.washington.edu/vehfire/fuels/detailedresults.html)), providing data for R134a (1370°F, or 743°C) and HFC-152a, but coverage was limited. For non-flammable refrigerants, it was noted as "Non-flammable," while for slightly flammable ones (A2L, like R417A), data was marked "Not found" due to lack of standard tables.

#### Notes and Observations
- **Boiling Points, Critical Temperatures, and Pressures**: These were sourced from the NIST CRC Handbook, ensuring accuracy for pure refrigerants and blends where data is available. For example, R134a’s boiling point (-26.1°C) aligns with standard engineering references.
- **Latent Heat of Evaporation**: From the ASHRAE Handbook, values for pure refrigerants like R134a (216.0 kJ/kg) were direct, while for blends (e.g., R401A, ~200.0 kJ/kg), estimations were made based on component properties due to limited direct data.
- **Self-Ignition Temperature**: Many refrigerants are classified as A1 (non-toxic, non-flammable) by ASHRAE Standard 34-2022, so self-ignition temperature is not applicable. For A2L refrigerants like R417A, specific data was not found in standard tables, marked as "Not found." This reflects the complexity of measuring self-ignition for blends.
- **Safety Classifications**: Included to clarify flammability, with A1 indicating non-flammable (e.g., R134a) and A2L indicating slightly flammable (e.g., R417A), based on ASHRAE standards.

#### Challenges and Limitations
Compiling self-ignition temperatures was challenging due to the non-flammable nature of many refrigerants. Searches for comprehensive tables led to partial data, such as R134a’s 743°C from a University of Washington page, but coverage for blends was limited. Estimations for latent heat of blends were necessary, acknowledging potential inaccuracies.

#### Conclusion
This table provides a robust overview of refrigerant properties, sourced from NIST and ASHRAE, with notes on estimations and missing data. It serves as a reliable reference for engineering applications, acknowledging the complexity of some properties, especially for blends.
